    "### Overview of the Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MaintenanceOptimization` class is designed to minimize the total cost of maintaining wind turbines by balancing two key costs:\n",
    "1. Maintenance Costs: Costs associated with repairing turbines based on the type and severity of faults.\n",
    "2. Downtime Costs: Losses when turbines are not producing energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class uses data from feature engineering (e.g., season, fault severity, high-demand periods) to adjust costs dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components and Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Inputs to the Class**\n",
    "- **`data`(DataFrame)**:\n",
    "  - The feature-engineered dataset with all necessary columns, such as:\n",
    "    - `Fault`: Type of fault (e.g., \"Routine\" or \"High-Severity\").\n",
    "    - `WEC: Production kWh`: Energy production in kWh, used to calculate downtime costs.\n",
    "    - `Is_High_Demand`: Indicator for high-demand seasons (1 for high-demand, 0 otherwise).\n",
    "    - `Season`: The season (e.g., Winter, Summer) for potential seasonal adjustments.\n",
    "- **`maintenance_costs`**:\n",
    "  - A dictionary specifying costs for different conditions:\n",
    "    - `'high_demand'`: Maintenance cost during high-demand seasons (e.g., summer).\n",
    "    - `'routine'`: Maintenance cost for routine faults.\n",
    "    - `'default'`: Maintenance cost for all other cases.\n",
    "- **`downtime_cost_per_kwh`**:\n",
    "  - A float representing the cost per kilowatt-hour of downtime (e.g. energy revenue lost when turbines are offline).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Variables in the Class**\n",
    "- **`self.model`**:\n",
    "  - The optimization problem (defined using PuLP) that minimizes the total cost.\n",
    "- **`self.downtime_vars`**:\n",
    "  - Decision variables representing the number of downtime hours for each observation in the dataset. \n",
    "  - Each observation has its own variable.\n",
    "    - Example: Downtime_0 represents downtime for the first observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Methods**\n",
    "- **`__init__`**:\n",
    "  - Initializes the class with input `data`, `maintenance_costs`, and `downtime_cost_per_kwh`.\n",
    "  - Sets up the optimization model and decision variables.\n",
    "- **`setup_objective`**:\n",
    "  - Constructs the **objective function** to minimize total costs:\n",
    "  - Combines:\n",
    "    - **Maintenance Costs**:\n",
    "      - Determined by `maintenance_costs` and fault/seasonal conditions.\n",
    "    - **Downtime Costs**:\n",
    "      - Based on lost production (`WEC: Production kwh`) and `downtime_cost_per_kwh`.\n",
    "    **Example**:\n",
    "      - For a **high-severity fault** during **Winter**:\n",
    "      - Maintenance Cost: `high_demand_cost * 1.1` (adjusted for Winter).\n",
    "        - Downtime Cost: `Lost Production kWh * downtime_cost_per_kwh`.\n",
    "- **`add_constraints`**:\n",
    "  - Adds constraints to ensure downtime does not exceed 24 hours per observation.\n",
    "- **`solve`**:\n",
    "  - Solves the optimization problem and returns the optimal values of decision variables (i.e., recommended downtime hours for each observation).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Outputs**\n",
    "- **Optimal Downtime**:\n",
    "   - The downtime values (e.g., `Downtime_0`, `Downtime_1`) for each observation.\n",
    "   - Suggests the best maintenance schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimized Total Cost**:\n",
    "   - The calculated minimized maintenance + downtime cost for the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Input Data Integration**\n",
    "- Feature-Engineered Data:\n",
    "  - The data DataFrame contains both feature-engineered columns (e.g., `Season`, `Fault_Severity`) and raw metrics (e.g., `WEC: Production kWh`).\n",
    "  - This allows the optimization to dynamically adjust maintenance and downtime costs based on meaningful patterns (e.g., high faults during winter or low production in fall).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Defining Maintenance Costs**\n",
    "- Maintenance costs are calculated for each observation:\n",
    "  - If the season is high-demand (e.g., summer): use `high_demand` cost.\n",
    "  - If the fault is routine: use `routine` cost.\n",
    "  - Otherwise, use `default` cost.\n",
    "  - Example: During winter, costs might increase by 10% (adjusted by season).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Calculating Downtime Costs**\n",
    "- Downtime costs depend on:\n",
    "  - `WEC: Production kWh`: Average energy production of the turbine.\n",
    "  - `downtime_vars[i]`: The downtime hours for observation `i`.\n",
    "  - Formula: `production_loss * downtime_cost_per_kwh`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Objective Function**\n",
    "- Combines maintenance and downtime costs\n",
    "  - $Total Cost = \\sum (Maintenance Cost) +  \\sum (Downtime Cost)$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Adding Constraints**\n",
    "- Ensures downtime variables do not exceed 24 hours (realistic daily downtime limits).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Solving the Problem**\n",
    "- The `solve()` method uses PuLP to compute the optimal downtime for each observation, minimizing the total cost.\n",
    "  \n",
